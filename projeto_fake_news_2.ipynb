It also challenges Ukrainian statehood and sovereignty and promotes recurring pro-Kremlin propagandistic narrative about Ukraine\\'s inevitable bleak future, its disintegration and imminent collapse.\\nThe claim that Germany and France play along with Russia is groundless. According to the Common Agreed Conclusions of the Normandy summit of 9 December 2019, \"The Minsk agreements (Minsk Protocol of 5 September 2014, Minsk Memorandum of 19 September 2014 and the Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015) continue to be the basis of the work of the Normandy format whose member states are committed to their full implementation.\" The Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015, among other things, without mentioning Russian personnel and hardware by name, calls for the \"withdrawal of all foreign armed formations, military equipment, as well as mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine under monitoring of the OSCE\" (para 10).\\nRead our articles about anti-Ukrainian propaganda Ukraine Under Information Fire and Five Years of Falsehoods: Was it Worth the While for the Kremlin? as well as earlier disinformation cases claiming that Ukraine invariably faces civil war and complete disintegration, that Ukraine will be disintegrated by 2023, that the Normandy summit aimed at solving Ukraine’s internal problems, and that Germany fabricated a\\xa0new “Skripal case” ahead of Normandy summit.\\n'"
