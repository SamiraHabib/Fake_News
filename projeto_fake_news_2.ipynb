It also challenges Ukrainian statehood and sovereignty and promotes recurring pro-Kremlin propagandistic narrative about Ukraine\\'s inevitable bleak future, its disintegration and imminent collapse.\\nThe claim that Germany and France play along with Russia is groundless. According to the Common Agreed Conclusions of the Normandy summit of 9 December 2019, \"The Minsk agreements (Minsk Protocol of 5 September 2014, Minsk Memorandum of 19 September 2014 and the Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015) continue to be the basis of the work of the Normandy format whose member states are committed to their full implementation.\" The Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015, among other things, without mentioning Russian personnel and hardware by name, calls for the \"withdrawal of all foreign armed formations, military equipment, as well as mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine under monitoring of the OSCE\" (para 10).\\nRead our articles about anti-Ukrainian propaganda Ukraine Under Information Fire and Five Years of Falsehoods: Was it Worth the While for the Kremlin? as well as earlier disinformation cases claiming that Ukraine invariably faces civil war and complete disintegration, that Ukraine will be disintegrated by 2023, that the Normandy summit aimed at solving Ukraine’s internal problems, and that Germany fabricated a\\xa0new “Skripal case” ahead of Normandy summit.\\n'"

            "Normandy summit results: the EU plays on Russia's side and betrayed Kyiv, no bright future for Ukraine Ukraine has put itself in a situation when external forces dictate how it should solve its internal problems Kyiv expected that its Western allies will put pressure on Russia in the Normandy Four format However the allies realised that their confrontation with Russia will cost them more Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel supported Russias position and put even bigger pressure on Ukraine than Vladimir Putin did Eventually Zelenskyy found himself in solitude because Russia Germany and France had nearly identical positions regarding the resolution of the civil conflict in Ukraine Ukrainian politicians wrongfully remain confident that the West will always unconditionally support any Russophobic regime and that Ukraine can just carry out its foreign policy and security under the Wests authority to enjoy its protectionUkraine could slam the door and declare that it no longer needs the Normandy format However it is the last remaining material evidence of Ukraines unity with the West and of its movement towards Europe which Kyiv can present to the Ukrainian people If the truth is told to the Ukrainians that Europe represented by Paris and Berlin is already playing along with Russia then Ukrainian people will reasonably question for what were people sacrificed and state and society destroyed if in the end Europe betrayed Ukraine Ukraine will never be in the EU and a bright future will never come This article misrepresents the actual German and French positions in the Normandy summit and masks the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014 as Ukraine's \"internal problems\" and \"civil conflict\". It also challenges Ukrainian statehood and sovereignty and promotes recurring pro-Kremlin propagandistic narrative about Ukraine's inevitable bleak future, its disintegration and imminent collapse.\n",
            "The claim that Germany and France play along with Russia is groundless. According to the Common Agreed Conclusions of the Normandy summit of 9 December 2019, \"The Minsk agreements (Minsk Protocol of 5 September 2014, Minsk Memorandum of 19 September 2014 and the Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015) continue to be the basis of the work of the Normandy format whose member states are committed to their full implementation.\" The Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015, among other things, without mentioning Russian personnel and hardware by name, calls for the \"withdrawal of all foreign armed formations, military equipment, as well as mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine under monitoring of the OSCE\" (para 10).\n",
            "Read our articles about anti-Ukrainian propaganda Ukraine Under Information Fire and Five Years of Falsehoods: Was it Worth the While for the Kremlin? as well as earlier disinformation cases claiming that Ukraine invariably faces civil war and complete disintegration, that Ukraine will be disintegrated by 2023, that the Normandy summit aimed at solving Ukraine’s internal problems, and that Germany fabricated a new “Skripal case” ahead of Normandy summit.\n",

The Polish Legions were established by Józef Piłsudski in August 1914 on the territory of Galicia - they became a formation of the Austro-Hungarian Army. Throughout 1917, the Austrian authorities disbanded the Legions as they refused to get subordinated to the German Army.

According to the bill, a whistle-blower is a person who, being convinced that the information is reliable, has reported facts of corruption or corruption-related offences, and other violations of law on the prevention of corruption to the relevant authorities. An employee with the relevant body may report on possible facts of corruption or corruption-related offences anonymously.\n",

This is one of many types of pro-Kremlin disinformation about the relations between Georgia and NATO.\n",
              " Speaking at the 5th Tbilisi International Conference co-organized by McCain Institute and Economic Policy Research Centre, former NATO Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen said [13:07 - 15:00] that in case of Georgia’s accession to the alliance, it should be discussed internally whether Article 5 covers only the territory that is actually controlled by the Georgian government and applies to the occupied territories only after Georgia restores its jurisdiction there. As an illustration, Rasmussen brought an example of Germany, saying that West Germany joined NATO in 1955, while East Germany became a member of the alliance only in 1990, following German reunification.\n",
              " “If one day we consider Georgia ready to join the alliance, we also have to make sure that Article 5 is still credible, which would require NATO to actually help Georgia, if Georgia is attacked. But obviously, it is the problem to have unresolved border disputes with Russia in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. So, the question is - how could that be resolved. I think you have to discuss internally in Georgia: would you in that case be willing to accept that Article 5 will only cover the territory that is actually controlled by the Georgian government. And the NATO will also have to reflect on exactly the same question,” Rasmussen said.\n",

              " As for the elections to the European Parliament in May 2019, a joint report from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission on election interference clearly states that “the evidence collected revealed a continued and sustained disinformation activity by Russian sources aiming to suppress turnout and influence voter preferences\" (p. 3).

              " Politicians who support the EU are routinely denigrated, ridiculed, or accused of corruption in pro-Kremlin media, while Eurosceptic voices are given prominence. In the weeks and months leading up to the European elections, these efforts have persisted in multiple languages.,\n",

              " While aware of pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns, the West is trying to keep open channels of communications and cooperation with Russia. For instance, NATO as the Western organisation created cooperation bodies – the Permanent Joint Council and the NATO-Russia Council – to embody its relationship with Russia. It also invited Russia to cooperate on missile defence. The Warsaw Summit Communique 2016 describes NATO's official policy towards Russia: \"The Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia. But we cannot, and will not, compromise on the principles on which our Alliance and security in Europe and North America rest.\"\n",

              " Ukraine lost 10 million citizens after the social genocide in 2014-2019 During another “five-year madness” after the coup d’état in 2014-2019 Ukraine lost almost 10 million citizens who were victims of the social genocide resulting from “100 successful reforms” The people died or left the country searching for jobs The recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about  Ukraine, its economy, and how it was ruined after 2014. It also repeats a disinformation narrative about the Euromaidan events in 2013-2014, portraying them as a coup d’état.\n",
              " The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim here.\n",
              " In the 2014-2019, the population of Ukraine has decreased from 45,2 million to 44,6 million people. According to the State Statistical Service of Ukraine, during 2015-2017 more than 1,3 million workers left Ukraine. According to the UN, in 2017 there were 5.9 million migrants from Ukraine in the world. The United Nations includes all immigrants who are born in but do not live in a country.\n",
              " According to the International Monetary Fund, the reforms after 2014 increased the growth rate of Ukraine's gross domestic product to 3 percent a year.

The Italian economy has been steadily recovering after the 2008-2009 financial crisis and a decline in 2014. Since 2015, Italian GDP has increased from 1.80 to 2.07 trillion USD.\n",
              " This improvement is confirmed by a 2018 report from the IMF: “The Italian economy has been recovering modestly from the global financial and Euro area sovereign debt crisis.” The report also highlights progress in raising employment and labour force participation. Continuing issues with the Italian economy are due to “longstanding structural weaknesses” such as sluggish income growth, elevated unemployment, and high public debt.\n",
              " Tourism in Italy continues to rise. The Italian Government Tourist Board (ENIT) states that, in 2018, Italy was visited by a record 94 million tourists. In 2017, tourism to Italy grew by 2.8%. As a result, tourism is becoming more important to the Italian economy. In 2018, it added 41.3 billion EUR to the economy, equivalent to 1.5% of GDP.,\n",

The investigative outlet Bellingcat has later revealed the identities of the two Russian nationals.\n",

Estimates vary considerably, but none come close to approaching the figure of 3 million. The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry cites several of these studies. For example, Guenter Lewy estimated that around 220,000 civilians in South Vietnam were killed in US, Army of the Republic of Vietnam and other allied land operations. In another study, Benjamin Valentino attributes 110,000-310,000 “counter guerrilla mass killings” to U.S. and South Vietnamese forces during the war. Estimates for the number of North Vietnamese civilian deaths resulting from US bombing range from 30,000-65,000, while higher estimates place the number of civilian deaths caused by American bombing of North Vietnam in Operation Rolling Thunder at 182,000.\n",

              " The data suggest a release from a nuclear reprocessing facility located in the Southern Urals, possibly from the Mayak nuclear complex.\n",
              " Scientists from 32 countries studied the release of ruthenium-106 for two years, a cloud of which covered Russia and Europe in 2017. The results of the study pointed to the Russian Mayak plant, which was engaged in the manufacture of a radioactive source for a neutrino experiment in Italy. Ruthenium-106 does not exist in nature, and Russian scientists obtain it from used nuclear fuel.\n",
              " A special group of scientists who investigated the causes of the radioactive cloud analysed the movement of the atmosphere over Russia and Europe. Scientists have analysed more than 1300 measurements of radioactive background from 176 stations in nearly 30 countries. These specialists concluded that the release of the hazardous substances occurred at the Russian Mayak plant from the evening of September 25th 2017 to noon on September 26th 2017.\n",
              " The authors of the study also reject the version about the possible fall of a satellite with a radioisotope source based on ruthenium on board. Scientists rejected the version that ruthenium-106 could have been thrown out as a result of an accident at the reactor: in this case, the atmosphere would have recorded elevated levels of other radioactive isotopes.\n",
              " In the Italian laboratory at the Gran Sasso Apennines in 2017, preparations were underway for an experiment aimed at identifying an elementary particle of matter, the so-called sterile neutrino. For this, Italy needed a source of strong radiation from radioactive cerium-144. The Russian plant Mayak was going to deliver it. After the accident, Russian scientists said they were not able to produce a cerium source of neutrinos with the necessary parameters.\n",

              " New head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, refuses to fight separatism in the EU In his new position as High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Spains interim Foreign Minister Josep Borrell refuses to fight separatism in the EU In an interview with the Spanish public national radio (RNE) he affirmed that his job “won’t be” to confront pro-independence positions This is a distortion of Josep Borrell’s statement. In the radio interview he was clearly talking about separatism in Catalonia. In the Sputnik article, it is ambiguously presented as a statement about separatist movement in general, inside the European Union. Mr Borrell also said that confronting pro-independence Catalan movement was not part of his new job, because “it is an internal problem of a member country”. Borrell’s exact words [in Spanish] were: “This is not a role for the High Representative of the European Union in Foreign Affairs,” adding that in such a position, Catalonia “will be a marginal question” for his duties. Affirming that he “refuses” to address this question is a gross manipulation of the truth.\n",

Investigations were conducted by the authorities of various countries, for example, Parliament's committee (UK). Numerous investigations have provided convincing evidence of Russian interference in the Brexit referendum and in elections across Europe and in the US.

              " The claim that the US “created” the image of Russia as a threat in order to prevent European-Russia cooperation does not reflect reality.  After the end of the Cold War until the 2014 Ukraine crisis, most US and Western policymakers no longer viewed Russia as an adversary, instead, taking the opinion that it could potentially become, or already was, a credible and responsible partner for Western states.\n",
              " The widespread assumption among US and European decision-makers was that economic, political and security cooperation with Russia, and its integration into the world economy, would encourage Russia’s democratic transition and modernisation, as well as its embrace of a foreign policy based on respect for international legal norms and support for the post-Cold War security architecture\n",
              " Even after the Russo-Georgian war in the summer of 2008, the US, the EU and most European states did not question the above-mentioned assumptions about Russia and continued to view Russia not as a security problem but as a key partner.  Thus, the Obama administration announced its “reset” policy in 2009 that aimed to restore a wide-ranging US-Russian partnership. The EU-Russia summits of 2009 and 2010 launched a “partnership for modernisation”.  Germany continued its strategic partnership policy towards Russia, and France and Italy pursued similar strategies based on increasing cooperation with Moscow.\n",

As a result of Russia’s aggressive actions in the Ukraine, many Western states - including key EU members such as Germany and France -  critically reassessed their “strategic partnership” policies towards Russia and began to view Russia as a serious challenge to the European security order.\n",
              " The annexation of Crimea also led NATO to change its perception of Russia and to reassess its view of Russia as a partner.

There were widespread detentions of peaceful protesters on election day. See here for the full statement on the elections by the EEAS spokesperson .\n",
              " Widespread irregularities and the arrests of peaceful protesters showed scant respect for democratic standards, said the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In its preliminary report the OSCE stated: \"The 9 June early presidential election in the Republic of Kazakhstan offered an important moment for potential political reforms, but it was tarnished by clear violations of fundamental freedoms as well as pressure on critical voices\". According to the OSCE, which sent 300 observers to Kazakhstan, \"significant irregularities were observed on election day, including cases of ballot box stuffing, and a disregard of counting procedures meant that an honest count could not be guaranteed\". \"The count was negatively assessed in more than half of observations, including cases of deliberate falsification, raising serious questions about whether ballots were counted and reported honestly as required by paragraph 7.4 of the 1990 OSCE Copenhagen Document. Meaningful transparency was not always provided to observers\". Finally, there were widespread detentions of peaceful protesters on election day in major cities, OSCE recalls.
